            <p>
              Contributed to the development of full-stack solutions supporting
              enterprise network operations and security. My primary focus was
              an access control application built on Cisco Identity Services
              Engine (ISE), where I developed a user-friendly front end and
              backend functionality in Python, integrating secure RESTful APIs
              to automate privilege management and maintain compliance-ready
              audit logs. I also built an AP Optimization Tool, a web-based
              dashboard that aggregates and analyzes Mist API data to improve
              visibility into access point performance across UPS facilities.
              Through this internship I gained experience in Python, SQL, API
              integration, web development, and enterprise networking, while
              strengthening my understanding of cybersecurity and secure
              infrastructure management at scale.
