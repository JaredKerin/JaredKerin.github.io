                <h1>UPS Technology Group: Software Developer Intern</h1>
                <p>During the time in this role I have contributed to the development of full-stack solutions that support enterprise network operations and security. My primary focus was an access control application, a security-driven platform designed to automate the management of user privileges within Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE). I leveraged my web development skill to build a user friendly front end and implemented backend functionality in Python, integrating secure RESTful API calls to dynamically adjust user access. I also designed and optimized SQL stored procedures to manage user records and maintain comprehensive audit logs in alignment with UPS’s compliance standards. In addition to this, I built an AP Optimization Tool, a web-based dashboard that aggregates and analyzes data from Mist APIs and internal systems to improve visibility into access point performance across UPS facilities. Through this internship I gained extensive experience in Python, SQL development, API integration, web technologies, and enterprise networking, while deepening my understanding of cybersecurity, access control, and secure infrastructure management within a worldwide network.
